shooting = permits["EventType"]
print(permits["EventType"].value_counts())	
print("There were" , shooting , "film permits.")

#Print out total number of permits per bourough in the file

print(permits["Borough"].value_counts())	

#print out the five most popular locations (stored in the column: "Parking Held").
