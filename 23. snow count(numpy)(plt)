#This program :  asks the user for the name of a .png file
#and print the number of pixels that are mostly white
#(the fraction of red, the fraction of green,
#and the fraction of blue are all above 0.75).

#Import the packages for images and arrays:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

file = input("Enter file name: ") # Prompts user to enter a message

ca = plt.imread(file)   #Read in image

#plt.imshow(ca)		           #Load image into pyplot
#plt.show()                         #Show the image (waits until closed to continue)

countSnow = 0            #Number of pixels that are almost white
t = 0.75                 #Threshold for almost white

#For every pixel:
for i in range(ca.shape[0]):
     for j in range(ca.shape[1]):
          #Check if red, green, and blue are > t:
          if (ca[i,j,0] > t) and (ca[i,j,1] > t) and (ca[i,j,2] > t):
               countSnow = countSnow + 1

print("Snow count is", countSnow)
