#This program :Modify the program from Lab 7 that displays shelter population
#over time to: Ask the user to specify the input file,
#Ask the user to specify the output file,

#Convert the date column (which is stored as 'YYYYMMDD') to a datetime format recognized by pandas, for example if your dataframe is df, overwrite the 'Date' column to be:
        #df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"].apply(str))
        
#Make a plot of the percent of absent students over time from the data in the input file, and
#Store the plot in the output file the user specified.



#Libraries for plotting and data processing:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


#prompts user to enter name of input file
file = input("Enter name of input file:")

#Open the CSV file and store in pop and prompts user to enter name of input file 
name = pd.read_csv(file)

# prompts user to enter name of output file and store in hs
hs = input("Enter name of output file:")

#Convert the date column (which is stored as 'YYYYMMDD') to a datetime format recognized by pandas, for example if your dataframe is df, overwrite the 'Date' column to be:
name["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(name["Date"].apply(str))    

#Compute the fraction of the percent of absent students, and save as new column:
name['% Absent'] = name['Absent']/name['Enrolled'] * 100


#Create a plot of the percent of absent students over time :
name.plot(x = 'Date', y = '% Absent')


#Save to the file:  
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.savefig(hs)
