#A program that:
#asks the user to specify the input file,
#ask the user to specify the output file,
#make a plot of the fraction of the total population that are single
#over time from the data in input file, and
#store the plot in the output file the user specified.


#Libraries for plotting and data processing:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


#prompts user to enter name of input file
file = input("Enter name of input file:")


#Open the CSV file and store in pop and prompts user to enter name of input file 
name = pd.read_csv(file)

# prompts user to enter name of output file and store in hs
hs = input("Enter name of output file:")

#Compute the fraction of the population that are single, and save as new column:
name['Fraction Single'] = name['Total Single Adults in Shelter']/name['Total Individuals in Shelter']

#Create a plot of population that are single over time :
name.plot(x = 'Date of Census', y = 'Fraction Single')

#Save to the file:  
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.savefig(hs)
