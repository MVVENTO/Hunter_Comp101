#Write a simplified machine language 
#Sample program that loops from 10 down to 0
#that has register $s0 loop through the numbers 0, 5, 10, ..., 50

#Sample program that loops from 0 up to 50
ADDI $s0, $zero, 0 #set s0 to 0
ADDI $s1, $zero, 5  #use to decrement counter, $s5
ADDI $s2, $zero, 50
AGAIN: ADD $s0, $s0, $s1
BEQ $s0, $s2, DONE
J AGAIN
DONE:  #To break out of the loop
