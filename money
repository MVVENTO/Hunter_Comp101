#This program :
#1.  Ask the user for the number of cents as an integer (e.g. 99 not 0.99).
#2.  Print out the number of quarters (quarters = cents // 25).
#3.  Compute the remaining change (rem = cents % 25).
#4.  Print out the number of dimes (dimes = rem // 10).
#5.  Compute the remaining change (rem = rem % 10).
#6.  Print out the number of nickels (nickels = rem // 5).
#7.  Print out the remaining cents (cents = rem % 5).
