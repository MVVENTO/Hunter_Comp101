#This program : Write a program that computes the minimum, maximum,
#average and standard deviation of the population over time
#for a borough (entered by the user).
#Your program should assume that the NYC historical population data file,
#nycHistPop.csv is in the same directory.

#import Libraries.
import pandas as pd

#open csv file and store in borough
pop = pd.read_csv('nycHistPop.csv',skiprows=5)

# prompts user to choose borough
bh = input("Enter borough:")

#Group the data by location minimum.
print("Minimum population:", pop[bh].min())

#Group the data by location maximum.
print("Maximum population:", pop[bh].max())

#Group the data by location average.
print("Average population:", pop[bh].mean())

#Group the data by location standard deviation.
print("Standard deviation:", pop[bh].std())
